After concentrating on hiring the best cooks and servers, the position of food runner may be an afterthought.

The best way is to first write down the traits that would make up the ideal food runner in your restaurant. After you’ve listed your ideal traits, use a template to build your job description around those traits. We’ve compiled the nine must-have traits for any food runner in our list below. We’ll then show you how to write the perfect food runner job description and give you a template to follow to produce your own.

## 9 Traits Of A Great Food Runner

The core traits of a great food runner are similar to the traits of a great server. In fact, starting your servers out as food runners is a great way to provide training and to see if they have what it takes to be the face of your restaurant. Look for the following key traits when you’re interviewing.

### 1. Organized

An effective food runner is an organized food runner. She’s going to be juggling a lot of responsibilities. And she’ll need to execute those responsibilities in a timely manner. A keen sense of organization will make those responsibilities run smoother and keep your restaurant humming along even at the busiest of times.

### 2. An Eye For Detail

The food runner is often the last employee to handle the food before it’s served to your customers. Because of that, the food runner needs to be able to tell at a glance if everything is right with the food or if something is wrong. That eye for detail extends to his surroundings as well. Could a customer use a drink refill? Is a table about to need bussing? Those little details can quickly add up over time and mean the difference between awesome service and just mediocre service.

### 3. Friendly

Food runners will interact extensively with customers, so they need to be friendly and personable. The dining experience is influenced, perhaps more than anything else, by the food runner’s tone of voice, attitude, and behavior. Friendliness will manifest as a relaxed air, even under stress.

### 4. Efficient

Nothing distracts your customers from a pleasant experience like employees rushing back and forth between the kitchen, the bar, and the tables. A good food runner will be efficient in everything he does and execute those responsibilities in a calm, yet prompt manner.

### 5. Knowledgeable About The Food

Chances are, when a food runner delivers the dishes to the table, there are going to be questions. “Ooh, this side looks delicious! What is it?” Or, “What cut of meat is this again?” A great food runner needs to be able to answer those questions without returning to the kitchen.

### 6. Good Communication Skills

The food runner is like a communication line between the dining room and the kitchen. She can help the chefs and other servers know what’s going on with customers so that they can keep things running smoothly. The food runner should be able to communicate clearly and efficiently.

### 7. Well-Mannered

Food runners need to understand the basics of good manners. Chief amongst those basics are listening, making eye contact, being polite, and smiling. Customers will notice the manners of all your staff, so it’s important for servers, food runners, bartenders, and the hosts to be well-mannered at all times.

### 8. Tidy

Part of a food runners job is to clean and clear the dining room when necessary. This cleanliness extends to the appearance of the plates, glasses, and silverware that the guests are using. The food runner should be able to recognize instances when cleaning is necessary and take steps to make it happen.

### 9. Team Player

You’ve heard it before, but we’ll say it again, “There is no ‘I’ in team.” We might extend that more specifically to the restaurant industry and say, “There is no ‘I’ in restaurant.” Food runners should understand this mentality and realize that they are the link between servers and chefs, customers and management. The food runner understands that she is not working on her own, but, rather, as part of a larger group of people who are all dependent on each other for a successful guest experience.

## Writing The Perfect Food Runner Job Description

Keep in mind that the nine traits listed above could be just the beginning. You may have another trait that is essential for your restaurant. In fact, you may have many others. Your list may be ten, eleven, or twelve traits. It all depends on what you need from your food runner. Regardless of how many traits you’ve listed, it’s now time to put those traits to use by creating the perfect food runner job description. Here’s how to do it.

First, break the job description into its four basic pieces: the job title, the job summary, responsibilities and duties, and qualifications and skills. Then, using the traits you identified earlier, tailor each section to fit your needs.

### 1. Job Title

Keep the job title as simple as possible. Usually one or two words will do. In this instance, write Food Runner, or possibly Expeditor. You don’t really need any of your traits here, but you could choose to amplify your job title with an adjective—For example, “Friendly Food Runner” or “Organized Expeditor.”

### 2. Job Summary

The job summary is where you start writing the traits for your perfect food runner. First, describe your restaurant and the role the food runner will play. Then, use words like “well-mannered”, “efficient”, and “friendly” to outline the duties the food runner will perform. Incorporating words that describe your ideal traits will help the job seeker determine if your job is really right for them. You can see an example of this in the sample food runner job description below.

### 3. Responsibilities And Duties

The 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/restaurant-employee-handbook/">responsibilities</a> and duties section of your perfect food runner job description is the place to list the details of the job rather than the traits you’re looking for in a food runner. That being said, you can still work in words that apply to your ideal traits so potential employees will continue to get the message you’re trying to convey. Think about incorporating terms like “team player”, “polite”, “eye for detail”, and others that reinforce the food runner traits you’re looking for. See the sample food runner job description below for an example.

### 4. Qualifications And Skills

This final section is where you list things like experience, education, and personality traits you want the candidate to have. Be sure to work in any of your traits that weren’t included in other sections.

Now let’s see how this all fits together in a sample food runner description.
