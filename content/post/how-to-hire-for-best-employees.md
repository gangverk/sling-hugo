Yeah, you’re busy these days...we are too. 
From dawn to dusk it seems like you’re on the go. Between work, family, friends, and getting to your yoga class on time, it’s seems like there’s no time left over for anything else, let alone a good skin care routine. But can you carve out twenty minutes here or there? Believe it or not, that’s all it takes to fight wrinkles, moisturize, promote collagen growth, and infuse your skin with nutrients. What product does all this in just a third of an hour? The disposable sheet mask, that’s what.

##What Sheet Masks Really Do?

Regardless of the ingredients they tout or the price tag they sport, all sheet masks do one very important thing: they moisturize. Yes, the fancy ingredients play a role in keeping your skin smooth and wrinkle-free, but the real power player in the equation is hydration. Hydration is the holy grail of the skin care world because it:

*Reduces inflammation

*Promotes collagen growth

*Slows the signs of aging

*Plumps skin

*Protects skin

*Fights acne

*Balances pH

And that’s just scratching the surface. There are very few things in the cosmetic world that are better for your skin than moisture. Forget all the chemicals with fancy names or the food extracts you’ve never heard of. Focus on the moisture, and your skin will thank you for it.

The twenty sheet masks below all do a fairly good job of moisturizing and nourishing your skin. But, as you’ll see at the end of this article, there’s a much better way to get the wrinkle prevention and healing you so need. First, though, let’s look at the twenty best face masks on the market today.
