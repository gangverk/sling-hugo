Time-off requests, like scheduling, can be a huge headache just waiting to happen. It may not be the most difficult part of your job, but it certainly is close to the top of the list. Trying to keep everyone happy while making sure your business runs smoothly can be a Herculean task. But you don’t have to be the mythical son of Zeus to conquer all your time-off requests. There are simple ways to handle this many-headed beast. This article shares 8 tips for handling time-off requests and show you the best solution for making the process much simpler.

## 1\. Define The Rules Of Time-Off Requests

Transparency and clarity of process are very important when dealing with time-off requests. Everyone—employees, management, and ownership alike—should know and understand the rules you set up to govern the business’s time-off requests.

Keeping your time-off process clear, and making sure everyone understands it, helps everything else run smoothly by avoiding conflict among you and your staff. Additionally, establishing rules for time-off requests shows that you respect both your employees and their time.

Rules for time-off requests should include:

1.  How requests should be submitted  

2.  When employees can request time off  

3.  When employees can’t request time off (e.g., special events)  

4.  How far in advance a time-off request needs to be made  

5.  Considerations that are specific to your business  

These rules should be clearly outlined in your [employee handbook](https://getsling.com/blog/post/restaurant-employee-handbook/). If you encounter problems along the way or see a need for new rules, don’t be afraid to make changes. You can also ask your employees what they would do to make the process simpler. This can help you see the time-off request procedure from a different perspective.

## 2\. Establish A Policy For Overlapping Requests

Inevitably, there will be overlapping time-off requests, especially around the holiday. This rush of time-off requests can cause friction between you and your employees, and between the employees themselves. This friction can then filter down and affect your customers.

A simple way to defuse these problems before they happen is to establish a policy that outlines how overlapping requests will be handled. That way, everyone understands why employee A got her time-off request approved while employee B didn’t.

The policy you establish for your business may be different than other businesses but that’s okay. It’s important to always do what’s right for you and your employees. Popular policies for overlapping time-off requests include:

1.  First come, first served  

2.  Reason for the request  

3.  Seniority-based  

4.  Managerial discretion  

You may even find that one policy isn’t enough. The most flexible policy may be a system that combines all four considerations, and others, into an overarching procedure for overlapping time-off requests.

## 3\. Make A Form That Everyone Should Use

Organization is key when it comes to [scheduling](https://getsling.com/blog/post/work-schedule/) time-off requests. Having one employee tell you directly about an upcoming time-off request, while another employee scribbles their request on a piece of scrap paper, is a recipe confusion.

To make the time-off request process as standardized as possible, create a form that everyone will use. Your form should, at the very least, include:

1.  The employee’s name  

2.  Date request is made  

3.  Time-off requested (date range or hour range)  

4.  Reason for time off  

5.  Employee’s signature  

6.  Manager’s signature  

7.  Approval/denial confirmation  

8.  Date request approved or denied  

You may find that you need more information on your time-off request form. That’s fine. As long as you have all the information necessary to make an informed decision. If you’re having a hard time getting your form ready, you can look online for [templates](https://www.hr.com/en/resources/free_forms/vacation-request_gitc4fn2.html) that make the process easier.

## 4\. Make It Easy For Employees To Submit Their Request

Making it easy for employees to submit their time-off requests is paramount for their happiness and yours. If your rules state that the employee needs to fill out a time-off request form and hand it to you directly, make sure you are available during work hours. If that’s not always possible, you might consider installing a time-off box (like a suggestion box) where employees can drop their request forms. Be sure to check the box often so you don’t miss a request.

As effective as manual submission can be, the simplest solution is often a digital one. Using a cloud-based submission system gives your employees (and you) the option to access time-off requests from anywhere and at any time. This is especially useful if an emergency arises and the employee has to leave immediately. The ubiquity of computers, tablets, and smartphones means that employee can still submit a time-off request and avoid any major conflicts from his absence.

Apps like [Sling](https://getsling.com) are the ideal choice for this situation. Sling is built specifically for restaurant use so the important features for requesting time off are already there. And the cloud-based nature of Sling makes it available at all hours of the day, pretty much anywhere on Earth.

## 5\. Keep All Your Time-Off Requests In One Place

There’s nothing worse than having an employee come to you wondering about their time-off request while you have no idea what they’re talking about. With paper copies of time-off requests, it can be extremely difficult to keep track of them all unless you are very well organized.

If you’re using paper request forms, a binder, folder, or index card box can keep everything in one place. Better yet, use a digital solution like Sling which keeps everything online in one easy-to-access place. Best of all, an online tool for organizing time-off requests, is always just a few clicks away. If you’re so motivated, you can work on the requests even when the restaurant is closed.

## 6\. Plan For Emergencies

The summer and major holidays often bring in lots and lots of time-off requests. Additionally, there will be times when emergencies just can’t be covered by another employee. When faced with these issues you can either work short-handed or have a plan ready and waiting.

The ideal plan for these types of situations includes a group of trusted and reliable part-time workers that you can call on in an emergency. These part-time workers can help fill in when time-off requests are at their highest or when an employee has to leave to attend to a sick child while all your other employees are either working on unavailable.

## 7\. Allow Employees To Find Their Own Replacements

Allowing employees to find their own replacements (shift trades) can make the time-off request process so much easier—on them and on you. If you allow shift trades, you should establish in your employee handbook the guidelines for this responsibility.

First, all trades or replacements should be approved by you or a manager. This is to ensure that the right skill mix is present during all shifts. Second, make sure that employees understand that there’s more to finding a substitute than just having a warm body present. The replacement should be someone who can do the same job—not a cook subbing for a waiter, or vice versa. As employees learn to identify the criteria you use when approving a replacement, they will get better at finding the right substitute on the first try. When that happens, you responsibility is drastically reduced and the time-off request process gets easier.

## 8\. Consider Your Business’s Needs

When time-off requests come in, it’s important to always consider your business’s needs along with your employee’s needs. First and foremost, you, as the [manager](https://getsling.com/blog/post/effective-leaders/), have to ensure that certain things get done on every shift. That means that you also need to ensure that the right people are working to get those jobs done. Because of those business needs, a time-off request may need to be turned down or delayed.

Make sure that all employees are aware of this caveat—business needs trump personal needs—but don’t go overboard and use this as an excuse not to approve time off. Doing so can alienate good employees. If you find yourself constantly denying a certain employee time off because of a function only they can fulfill, it may be time to train someone else to do that job as well.

### Use The Right Tool To Keep Everything Organized

The easiest way to handle time-off requests is by using the right tool. The best tools satisfy a large number of the above suggestions and remove the difficulty inherent in scheduling time-off requests.

Sling, for example, makes it easy and convenient for employees to submit their requests online. Sling also stores all those requests in one, easy-to-access location (online) so you can get to them day or night. To further simplify the process, Sling makes all requests look the same so you don’t have to make up your own form. Sling also allows employees the ability to find and schedule their own replacements right online. You sign off on the substitution, but you don’t have to do the searching. The employee does it for you.

Additionally, Sling does what other apps don’t. Because it is built for restaurants, Sling notifies you if you’ve scheduled conflicting time-off requests and can even offer suggestions for how to remedy the situation. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Sling makes the entire scheduling process—not just time-off requests—easier, more streamlined, and less of a headache for you.
