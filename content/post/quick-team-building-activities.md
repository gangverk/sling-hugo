+++
Building a cohesive team is important for any business. But too many [leaders](https://getsling.com/blog/post/effective-leaders/) make team building into a time-consuming, expensive process.

It doesn’t have to be that complicated. It can be as simple as a round of drinks, group calisthenics, or a quick game of Pictionary. No psychology necessary. This article will show you 12 of the best quick team-building activities to keep your employees [engaged](https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-engagement-ideas/) and working well together.

## 1\. Group Calisthenics

Keep this option relatively simple so your employees don’t find it too difficult (or get too sweaty). Bodyweight exercises are your best bet. Jumping jacks, air squats, push ups, and/or burpees are just a few of the exercises you can choose from. Pick one and do a couple of sets of 5 to 10 repetitions. Or for increased impact, mix a few of the exercises together and do two or three rounds. Be sure to rest between set. The team that exercises together stays together.

## 2\. Knot My Job

First, assemble enough string or rope so that all your employees can have an equal piece. Then, gather everyone together, distribute the string, and challenge each team member to tie as many simple [overhand](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexbasics.php#ScrollPoint) knots as possible in a set amount of time. If there’s a tie for the most knots, challenge those employees to see how many knots they can untie in that same amount of time. The employee with the most knots tied or untied wins.

## 3\. A Round Of Drinks

Sometimes, quick team-building activities don’t have to be games. Leave the office early or gather after work hours and treat your team members to a round of drinks on you at the local watering hole. Just make sure everyone’s okay to drive afterwards.

Alternatively, you could hire a portable bar and bartender to set up and serve after-lunch drinks to your team. Make sure you all stay together like you would if you went out. This can be a great way for members of your team to get to know one another better.

## 4\. Team Crossword Puzzle Race

First, make two copies of the same crossword puzzle. [The New York Times crossword](http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/index.html?page=home&_r=0) can make for an interesting challenge. Or you can pull a simple puzzle off the internet. Just make sure the puzzles you use are identical and that you have access to the correct answers.

Second, divide into teams and give each team a crossword puzzle. Then challenge the teams to fill in the crossword puzzle in a set amount of time. If no one completes the crossword in the time you set, the team with the most correct answers wins.

## 5\. Pictionary Throughout The Day

This quick team-building activity requires a bit of preparation but the extra effort is worth it. You’ll need an easel, a pad of paper, markers, and some Pictionary cards. To make the game simple, run each round like the old Pictionary TV show.

Divide your employees into two teams. Draw a Pictionary card and choose a word. Give one player from team A two minutes to draw while her teammates try to guess—they can shout out answers as she draws. When time runs out, give team A one more guess. If they don’t get the right answer, give team B one guess as a chance to steal. Then switch sides and let team B draw.

Because these rounds a fairly short, you can conduct a number of them throughout the day. You can keep the same teams all day and calculate the total score at the end to determine the winning team. Or you can treat each session as its own game and mix and match the teams every time.

## 6\. Mario Kart For Nintendo 64

This may be one of the greatest quick team-building activities ever. All you need is a TV, a Nintendo 64, and a copy of the classic Mario Kart video game. If possible, get four controllers so you can involve more players at a time.

If you have four controllers, divide your employees into teams of two and pit one team against another. Alternatively, you can have each employee play for himself. If you’ve got the time, let the winners of each round play against each other until there’s only one team (or individual) left. Get everyone playing together and you’ll create a team that feels cohesive, engaged, and [appreciated](https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-appreciation/).

## 7\. Answer Trivia Questions

This quick team-building activity can be played in many different ways, but all you need is a bunch of trivia questions to make it work. If you can get your hands on a Trivial Pursuit game, you’ll be covered. If not, just type “trivia questions” into your favorite search engine for plenty of material.

Divide employees into two teams. Ask the question and give team A one minute to answer. If they don’t know the answer, give team B 10 seconds to steal. Then reverse roles and give team B a new question.

If you have the opportunity to get ahold of some type of buzzer, you can have a head-to-head trivia face off where both teams can answer. The team that buzzes in first gets to answer. If they get it wrong, the other team has the opportunity to steal. Get creative with how you play the game and your employees will have the time of their life.

## 8\. Group Meditation

Group meditation is a great way to give your employees a break from their [busy work day](https://getsling.com/blog/post/work-schedule-app/) while at the same time building a more cohesive team. The [benefits](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/19/meditation-benefits_n_5842870.html) of meditation are significant. Meditation, among other things, reduces stress, improves concentration, increases happiness, and benefits cardiovascular and immune health. All great things for keeping your employees happy and [healthy](http://muscles.zone/15-rules-live-optimal-health/).

If possible, get enough yoga mats so that everyone can lie on the floor. In addition, you may have to bring in someone who is familiar with running a meditation session so your employees get the most out of this quick team-building activity.

## 9\. Fact Or Fiction

At the beginning of the workday, have your employees write their name on one side of a note card. Then, have them write two facts and one fiction (two truths and one lie) about themselves. Make sure they label which are true and which are false. It’s also a good idea to tell your employees not to make the lie too outlandish. “I’ve been to Mars” is much more of an obvious lie than “I’ve been to Antarctica.”

Gather everyone together in a circle and then choose someone to reveal the three pieces of information about themselves. It might even be a good idea for you to start the process. Then allow the rest of the group to decide what is fact and what is fiction. Give time for questions if the facts are really unique. This is another great way to get to know a bit more about your team members.

## 10\. One-Minute Typing Test

Print a copy of a fairly long news story. Then give each employee one minute to correctly type as much of the news story as possible. All you need is a simple word processor with word count capabilities so you don’t have to count each individual word. Alternatively, you can use a typing test website (like [TypingTest.com](http://www.typingtest.com/)) if you have access to the internet. The team member who types the most, or has the fastest speed, wins.

## 11\. Treasure Hunt

Get two of the same object— empty carafes or pans work well. Label one “A” and the other “B”. Hide these objects in the workplace (either together or apart). Gather your employees together and divide them into team A and team B. Then give them a clue or just tell them that you’ve hidden labeled objects somewhere nearby. Give them two minutes to find their team’s object. First one to hand the object to you wins. If no one finds their team’s object in the two minutes, run the treasure hunt again an hour or two later.

## 12\. Watch A Funny YouTube Video

There’s so much out there to make us laugh these days and YouTube has pretty much all of it. Take some time out of your [busy schedule](https://getsling.com/blog/post/schedule-my-employees/), gather the troops together, and watch a hilarious viral video. There are so many to choose from you really can’t go wrong. One of our favorites is this [Bad Lip Reading of the NFL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-kGosnzvjU&feature=player_embedded).
