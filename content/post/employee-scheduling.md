If you’ve ever managed a restaurant, you’ve probably experienced the pain associated with employee scheduling. Trying to format the document just so. Finding room for everything. Making changes. And getting it into the hands of employees in plenty of time. This is partly due to the fact that many restaurants still rely on the [pen-and-paper](https://getsling.com/blog/post/free-employee-scheduling-software/) method for schedule creation. Often, their method of distribution—tacking the schedule to a wall—is equally as [low-tech](https://getsling.com/blog/post/low-tech-industry-going-high-tech/).

Even the introduction of computers into the scheduling process hasn’t helped much. That’s because the traditional computer-based methods for scheduling—Excel spreadsheets and email—are just small steps up from the pen-and-paper method. They don’t really solve the problems and may actually introduce more.

But there is hope. Effective, problem-free employee scheduling for restaurants is possible. Before we look at the solution in detail, let’s look deeper into the challenges restaurants face when it comes to scheduling. Then we’ll look at some best practices that help to solve these problems.

## Employee Scheduling Challenges

The scheduling challenges faced by restaurant managers are legion. Planning, sharing with your team, and off-the-shelf tools that fall short are three of the biggest.

## Planning

The problem with the pen-and-paper method is that it’s permanent. When you create a schedule on paper, it can’t be altered without creating an entirely new document.

And the potential for errors with the pen-and-paper method is always high. Did you forget a time-off request? Did you double book an employee? Did you make the right change after employee A called in sick? Though the pen-and-paper method has been around for many years, it’s quickly becoming outdated and impractical.

Computers have made the process easier, but they’re still not being utilized to their potential. Though the Excel spreadsheet is computer-based, it’s really only a small step up from the pen-and-paper method on which it’s based. Yes, the Excel spreadsheet is much easier to change when the need arises. But the spreadsheet still faces problems with distribution (which we’ll talk about below) as well as the potential for errors. Even cloud-based documents and spreadsheets, like Google Docs and Sheets, still possess many of the same problems.

## Sharing with your team

If the methods used to create the schedule weren’t difficult enough, then comes the challenge of sharing with the team.

Posting your schedule on the wall has been around for a long time. But old doesn’t necessarily mean best. Posting the schedule doesn’t guarantee that all your employees will see it. And then what happens when changes need to be made? How can you be sure that everyone sees it again?

You could choose to share the schedule via email. Yes, this is an easy way to get it into everyone’s hands quickly. But there’s still the problem of redistributing it when changes need to be made. When you send multiple versions of a schedule, the likelihood for confusion grows with each new version. And then there’s the fact that more and more [young people](https://getsling.com/blog/post/managing-millennials/)—the majority of your workforce—don’t use email frequently, if at all.

## Employee Scheduling Best Practices

As real as those challenges are, if you follow a few best practices, the scheduling process will improve. You’ll be happier. And your employees will be happier too.

### 1\. Get the schedule into your employees’ hands quickly

Your employees need time to adjust to the new schedule. And you need to allow time for changes to be made. It’s important, then, to get the schedule into their hands as quickly as possible.

Try using a cloud-based program that allows you to post your schedule online where everyone can see it. The beauty of these programs is that there’s only one document and everyone refers to it online. When you make changes to the schedule, they are immediately visible to everyone involved. It cuts down on the confusion of having multiple copies of a schedule floating around.

### 2\. Communicate quickly and easily with employees

Communicating quickly and easily with a large group of people to find substitutes, or just to give out information, can be a real challenge. As mentioned, email doesn’t solve this problem because not all your employees use it regularly. And calling everyone is just not a good use of your time.

Try using an automated notification software or harnessing the power of texting and chatting to reach your employees en masse. For example, sending out a notification or a text informing your available employees that a shift has opened up in two hours. They can then text you back to let you know if they can cover the shift. This is a much quicker method of communication than trying to call everyone individually and really cuts down on the time you have to spend on the problem.

### 3\. Honor time-off requests and work preferences

Honoring time-off requests and work preferences creates goodwill. It also increases employee satisfaction and goes a long way toward helping retain good workers.

Keep all time-off requests and work preferences in one place—whether it’s in a folder or on your computer—and refer to them often when making your schedule. An efficient way to do this is to use a central, cloud-based document to keep track of time-off requests and work preferences. Give your employees access to this document and then have them submit their requests accordingly. That way, everyone is working off one document instead of having the information spread here and there.

### 4\. Schedule to your employees’ strengths

Employee A is a whiz at efficiency while employee B is a master at small talk. Harness these skills and schedule each employee where they can do the most good.

Employee A would be best suited for the lunch rush when speed and efficiency are most important. Employee B would be best suited for dinner when diners have more time and the extra communication can make diners feel more welcome.

Keep notes about your employees’ strengths (and weaknesses) and be sure to factor those in when making up the schedule.

### 5\. Allow for changes

Even the best schedule will need to be changed now and again. Emergencies pop up and conflicts between work and personal life come about quickly. As such, it’s important to be flexible with changes to the schedule.

Allow employees to alter the schedule and encourage them to find substitutes, not just say they can’t work. Try using a cloud-based program that allows for collaboration (like a Google Sheet). After you create the document and give your employees access, the can make changes to the schedule and trade shifts as necessary. As an added bonus, you’ll be notified when changes have been made so you can verify that it works. By giving employees the leeway to shuffle things around, you take a good portion of the stress and strain off your own shoulders.

### 6\. Prevent no-shows

Preventing no-shows used to be a full time job. Now, with the ubiquity of mobile phones and devices, getting everyone to show up for their shift is a lot easier.

Try incorporating an automatic reminder app that sends text messages informing employees of an upcoming shift. Even just sending out a text in the morning reminding everyone that they’re working that day can prevent no-shows from happening. It also gives you plenty of time should you have to find a substitute.

### 7\. Use software that is specific to the restaurant industry

Restaurant-specific software solutions, like Sling, are available to everyone these days. These software solutions contain powerful features that help make schedule creation easier. They will notify you when you’ve double booked an employee. They will notify you when you’ve forgotten a time-off request.
