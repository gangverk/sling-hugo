The perfect work schedule is something many managers strive for. Unfortunately, few actually achieve it. This despite the fact that technology make it easy to streamline the process and get it right the first time.

Whether you make use of online scheduling apps, have your own tools like Excel, or rely on the pen-and-paper method, there are some important points to keep in mind. These points range from building shifts around your best employees to planning for the worst to using the best tools for the job. This article will discuss 6 tips for creating the perfect work schedule for your team.

## 1\. Build Shifts Around Your Best Employees

We all know who our best employees are. If you don’t, it’s time to make a list. Consider traits like efficiency, personableness, experience, and how well they work with others. Once you have your list, build shifts around the employees best suited for that particular time.

This serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the employee(s) most suited to each shift are working then. So, for example, the most efficient employees work during the biggest rush (lunch) while the more personable employees work when customers are more likely to linger (dinner). That isn’t to say that you don’t want some semblance of efficiency and personableness on every shift, but an employee who is more likely to stand around and chat with a customer for five minutes probably isn’t the first choice for the mid-day rush.

The second purpose served by building shifts around your best employees, is that you know you have a core of experience on which other employees can rely. An experienced employee can quickly improve the quality of a shift because other, less experienced, employees watch, learn, and rise to the higher standards. Mixing some of your best employees with some of your newer employees is a great way to create stability across all shifts.

## 2\. Establish A Team-Wide Communication Method

Communication is important for any business. But in the restaurant and retail industries, it can mean the difference between having enough employees to cover a shift and being short-staffed. Establishing a team-wide communication method makes it easy for you and your employees to know exactly where to look for your work schedule. There’s no more searching through email, instant message, and texting apps to find the newest work schedule or that time-off request you need. Everyone uses the same tool so everyone’s on the same page.

If you haven’t already, set up this team-wide communication method right away. With most people using smartphones these days, your best bet is to choose a method that makes use of this omni-present technology. Texting is one such method. Instant messaging is another.

Another great option is an app like [Sling](https://getsling.com/). Sling is a tool made specifically for restaurants so it takes all the guesswork out of this important step. Apps like Sling couple powerful scheduling tools with equally powerful communications tools. This allows you to improve internal communication through chatting and the sharing of messages, photos, videos, and links. In addition, you can communicate with a specific individual, a group, or all employees at the same time. These and other communication features make apps like Sling your best bet for team-wide communication.

## 3\. Get Employees To Do Some Of The Work Schedule

The thing about scheduling that most managers forget is that they don’t have to do all the heavy lifting on their own. Providing your employees with the opportunity to do some of the scheduling themselves is a great way to:

Take some of the burden off yourself.

Keep them engaged in their work.

Consider scheduling one or two of your best employees for each shift (see #1 above) as a way to start. Then give everyone access to this incomplete schedule and allow them to fill in when they want to work.

If you want to try this method of scheduling, allow changes for a set period of time (maybe two days) then close the schedule to outside alteration. Finally, go through and make changes according to what each shift needs. When everything is finished to your satisfaction, make the schedule available to everyone again.

If you’ve been scheduling everything right from the get-go, you might consider trying this new method for a few months to see how it works. Scheduling apps like Sling make this easy. You create a common document online and then give everyone access to that document for a few days. When it’s time to finalize the schedule, close the document, make your changes, and then reopen it for viewing. It’s just that easy.

## 4\. Let Employees Find Their Own Substitutes

Giving your employees the responsibility to find a substitute to cover their shift when they can’t work is another way you can reduce your own workload. Instead of having the employee call you to say they won’t be coming in today, the employee can send out a notification informing everyone that he’s sick and that he needs a substitute. The team-wide communication network mentioned in step #2 above is the cornerstone of this process.

Other employees willing to work can respond equally as fast. Something that might have taken an hour or more and countless phone calls on your part, can now be concluded in a matter of minutes. Of course, you should have the final say in the substitution but that’s a lot simpler than trying to find someone to work on your own.

Requiring that they find their own substitutes is a great way to instill a sense of maturity and thoughtfulness in your employees. In addition, it helps them be [engaged](https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-engagement-ideas/) in the business and think about what is involved in the scheduling process. By showing your employees what is involved in creating a work schedule and finding substitutes, you can create a sense that the schedule is not something to be changed willy-nilly. If they are scheduled and they are able, they need to work.

## 5\. Create An Availability Chart

Sometimes an employee can’t find a substitute to cover their shift. When that happens, it’s up to you to find someone to work. It’s times like those when an availability chart makes the whole thing go so much smoother.

Emergencies will come up. It’s inevitable. But rather than leaving it all to chance, an availability chart can act as your “plan B”. The simplest version is just a list of each employee and what days and times they’re available to work. They may not be scheduled for all those days and times and, so, might be willing to pick up an extra shift here or there. The more complicated version is another full schedule listing available employees who can come in during each and every shift.

Think of your availability chart like the second string on a basketball team. If someone can’t “play”, you’ve got a number of choices who would be willing to come off the bench. Ultimately, this simplifies the substitute process by taking the thought out of it. It can also reduce the stress involved when the need for a last-minute substitute arises.

## 6\. Use The Best Tool For The Job

If you’ve ever tried to drive a nail with a screwdriver, you know the importance of using the best tools for the job at hand. Creating a work schedule is no different. [The right tools](https://getsling.com/blog/post/free-employee-scheduling-software/) can make the job easier and quicker to complete.

Even tools meant for other purposes (like Word or Excel) can streamline the scheduling process when compared to the age-old pen-and-paper method. And now, with cloud computing penetrating every corner of the business world, free online versions of Word and Excel (e.g., Google Docs and Sheets) make the process even simpler.

So while you may already be using one or the other of these apps, is it really the best fit for the job? Is there a better tool available? For restaurants, there are tools available that are specifically tailored to the restaurant industry.

Apps like [Sling](https://getsling.com/) provide everything the savvy manager needs to create the perfect work schedule in no time. And best of all, Sling is free to use.
