## Traits That Make For A Great Barista

The ideal traits you choose to look for in a great barista will depend on what you need from your employees and how your business operates. But whether you’re [managing](https://getsling.com/blog/post/restaurant-management-tips/) a national chain with hundreds of locations, or a mom-and-pop operation with just one location, there are nine core traits that any good barista should exhibit. Use these traits as the basis for your list and then include them in your job description and look for them when you’re interviewing.

### 1. Organized

A great barista is an organized barista. This means that she should be able to manage tasks in a prompt manner and deliver a customer’s order as soon as possible. Organization is especially important during peak hours when customers are in a rush and expect fast service. An organized barista will be able to handle multiple tasks at the same time in order to provide the best customer service.

### 2. Friendly

A good barista shows genuine happiness to serve customers. Additionally, he understands that he is, in large part, responsible for the customer’s experience and that his friendliness plays a large role in making that experience pleasurable. This trait is shown through a relaxed tone of voice, pleasant attitude, and kind behavior even under stress.

### 3. Efficient

A good barista should always strive to be efficient in everything she does. That means not wasting time, avoiding mistakes, and doing high-quality work. Efficiency doesn’t mean she should be rushed. A barista who looks like she’s hurrying between tasks can become an unnecessary distraction for your customers. More than anything, she should strive to produce customer orders in a prompt fashion without looking hurried or flustered.

### 4. Good Manners

Good manners are important for any job that requires contact with customers. That’s because good manners can have a dramatic effect on the image of your business. You may serve the best venti triple mocha frappuccino in the state, but if your barista’s manners aren’t what they should be, customers will go elsewhere. Good manners means being polite, making eye contact, smiling, and paying attention when the customer talks.

### 5. Cleanly

Cleanliness is one of the most important characteristics of a business where food and drink are served. This cleanliness encompasses all aspects of the customer experience, from floors to tables to counters to the barista himself. A good barista places a priority on the image she creates by keeping her environment and her appearance neat and tidy.

### 6. Strong Communication

A good barista should be able to communicate effectively and clearly with other employees and customers alike. If there are questions, the barista should be able to answer them with relevant information so that the customer is satisfied. If instructions need to be given to another employee, the barista should be able to deliver that information quickly and concisely.

### 7. Team-Orientated

Baristas should understand that they are part of a [team](https://getsling.com/blog/post/restaurant-staffing/) that is working to create a good customer experience. The barista should understand that he is not working by himself, but as part of a larger group of people that are dependent on one another for success. When a team cooperates and works together well, they can make even the busiest times of the day seem like a walk in the park. That’s the kind of [productive](https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-engagement-ideas/) team you want to build in your business. It starts by hiring a barista who understands the importance of teamwork.

### 8. Adaptable

Baristas often have to deal with custom orders. Customers want to personalize their drinks so the employee taking or blending that order should be adaptable. The barista needs to put her own personal preferences aside and provide for the customer’s likes and dislikes. By being open to change, the barista can ensure that all customers will get what they want.

### 9. Detail Oriented

Attention to detail is an important quality for every barista. Customer orders can get quite complex. And whether the barista is entering that order into the POS software or actually making the order, he needs to have an eye for detail. It can be very easy to leave out one ingredient during busy hours, but that ingredient can mean the difference between a customer leaving pleased or displeased. A detail oriented barista will make sure that all orders are complete before delivering them to the customer.
