Scheduling your employees never seems to get easier, does it? There are so many moving parts to coordinate: time-off requests, overtime, getting the right people working the right shifts, training new employees, finding substitutes, dealing with emergencies...the list goes on and on.

Thankfully, modern mobile technology has introduced ways to make the entire process more streamlined. First, make use of some important essential strategies. For example, create the schedule well in advance, make the schedule easy to read and easy to access, make it easy for staff to indicate their availability, communicate and keep everyone updated, and always, always have a plan B. These ‘best practices’ can help streamline the scheduling process and keep things running smoothly.

One big way to make scheduling easier is to use a work schedule app. These apps help you keep track of who works when while at the same time taking the fuss out of distributing the schedule, changing the schedule, scheduling to your employees’ strengths, and preventing no-shows. But what is the best work schedule app? This article will discuss 7 of them. At the end, we’ll focus on the Sling app that can help you schedule, communicate, build company culture, keep employees engaged, set tasks, and so much more.

## 1\. Schedule Planner

Schedule Planner is a work schedule app that can help you take control of the employee scheduling process. The app allows you to create unlimited color-coded fields that can be used to represent your employees. These fields can then be distributed on the calendar interface to indicate when an employee works.

Like Google Calendar, Schedule Planner is cloud-based so distribution, changes, and collaboration are streamlined down to just a few taps of the screen. Keep in mind that Schedule Planner was intended for a single individual so complicated scheduling like overlapping shifts may not be easy, or even possible, with this work schedule app. It’s a simple scheduling tool but it wasn’t created with restaurants or retail businesses in mind.

## 2\. Fantastical 2

Fantastical 2 (the emphasis is on the ‘cal’, as in calendar) is another work schedule app that can help take the stress out of scheduling your employees. Like other scheduling apps, employees can be entered as tasks and color coded to set them apart from each other. Users can then view the schedule by day, week, or even month. Users can even search the schedule to see past, present, and future events that apply to them.

While Fantastical 2 does have some powerful features (like Apple Watch support and 6 different languages), it was built mainly for a single user. Yes, it can be forced to work for multiple people and complex scheduling, but why go to the effort of pushing a square peg into a round hole? There are other work schedule app options that fit better.

## 3\. WorkTime

As the name implies, WorkTime is all about scheduling and tracking work time. This work schedule app lets you create and track complex work schedules with ease. Users can enter a shift in just a few easy taps and then view the entire week’s schedule all on one screen.

Professional-level features like unlimited jobs, alarms and notifications, and even schedule sharing via Facebook, Twitter, or email make this a useful app for scheduling employees. Users can even add up hours worked and wages earned with WorkTime’s hours calculator.

But, like many of the other work schedule apps on this list, WorkTime was really only intended for a single user. On top of that, it doesn’t have any features to help you during the scheduling process. Really, only one work schedule app does.

## 4\. Google Docs

As work schedule apps go, Google Docs is pretty basic. It starts out as just a blank sheet of paper so you have to do a lot of extra work to get the schedule looking like a schedule. That may be a deterrent to some folks, as it should be. There are better ways—better apps—to simplify the scheduling process.

The nice thing about Google Docs is that it’s cloud-based. This means that employees can get access to the schedule at any time or in any place. For you, it means that distribution is easier, as is receiving change requests and making alterations. Google Docs might not be the first choice for a work schedule app, but it’s a start.

## 5\. Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a step up from Google Docs in that it already has the columns, rows, and cells formatted and ready to go. This removes one big step from the scheduling chore and makes Sheets one of the first work schedule apps that many turn to.

Google Sheets gives you the flexibility and ease of alteration that comes with a spreadsheet along with the streamlined distribution and alteration that comes with cloud-based apps. Spreadsheets were created for database manipulation and accounting, so common restaurant needs may not addressed by apps like Google Sheets. These apps cover the basics but don’t offer any more help than that.

## 6\. Google Calendar

Google Calendar combines the simplicity of a calendar view with the accessibility of a cloud-based work schedule app. For you, the manager, the calendar view means that the process of scheduling will be simpler and more intuitive. That’s a win all by itself. For your employees, the calendar view means that the completed schedule will be easy to understand. That means that confusion over who works when will be drastically reduced.

The cloud-based nature of this work schedule app means that distribution problems will be a thing of the past. Everyone has some sort of access to the master document via the internet. They can check it anytime they want, wherever they may be. They can also make limited changes to the document and communicate conflicts and other problems via comments within the app. All of this put together reduces the time and the stress it takes to create a successful schedule.

That said, it’s important to keep in mind that Google Calendar can be difficult to use if you have more than 5 employees. It, like so many other calendar apps, was created to schedule activities for a single user. Because of that, it doesn’t have many of the features that a growing restaurant or retail business might need.

## 7\. Sling

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Sling is a work schedule app made specifically for restaurants, retail, hotel, and healthcare. It combines cloud-based distribution with powerful scheduling features that make even the most complicated schedule into a piece of cake.</span>  

Sling makes it easy to schedule a large number of employees thanks to the ability to copy schedules between days and weeks, or simply dragging and dropping shifts where you like them. You can even create recurring shifts that appear in the same place every time.

Sling also helps you eliminate conflicts during the scheduling process by providing alerts and notifications when you’ve overlapped shifts or double booked someone. Other powerful features help you reduce no-shows and get everyone to work on time. Managers can set up and send push notifications to remind employees when they have to work. Users can even send messages, files, photos, videos, and links to one person, a user-defined group of people, or everyone at the same time using Sling’s powerful communication features. And the fact that Sling works anywhere, all the time, means you can keep your team informed and engaged, and build better company culture without working 24/7\. Check it out for yourself and try it for free.

### The Best Work Schedule App Should Help You Manage Better

While many apps make the scheduling process simpler, only a handful, like Sling, actually provide tools that help you in all aspects of managing your restaurant, retail store, hotel, or healthcare business. From establishing your own business-based newsfeed for employees to creating tasks that help everyone work better, these types of work schedule apps really are the best choice for busy managers.
