+++
You got into the restaurant business because you love food and you want to make people happy with that food. It’s a noble pursuit and one that seems relatively simple on the surface: make food, serve it to people. But underneath that simple premise is a whole host of complex responsibilities that you may not be trained for, nor particularly enjoy.

Chief amongst those complex responsibilities is restaurant accounting. Restaurant accounting is one of the most important aspects of making your business successful, but is often overlooked (or avoided) because it can be difficult tracking and making sense of all those numbers.

But there is light at the end of the tunnel. Restaurant accounting doesn’t have to be feared and put off until the last minute. There are ways to simplify and streamline the process. This article will discuss 8 steps to effective restaurant accounting.

## 1\. Learn The Language

Most of us are not trained accountants. Because of this, the terms we are forced to learn are like a completely new language. Yes, they’re English words but they might as well be cyrillic for all the meaning they convey. Terms like revenue, profit-and-loss, prime cost, red, black, and a whole host of others, can have your head swimming in no time. What exactly do those terms mean? What constitutes revenue and what constitutes expenses? What does a profit-and-loss statement tell me? What’s the [difference](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/similarities-differences-between-accounting-bookkeeping-59002.html) between bookkeeping and accounting?

It may seem like an uphill battle, but just learning the definitions for the most important terms can give you incredible insight into the financial side of your restaurant. Websites like [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/university/accounting/) can be a great start for those unfamiliar with the processes involved in tracking money. But if it just seems too daunting for you to handle, consider the next step as the most important.

## 2\. Hire An Accountant

Hiring an accountant to help you with your finances is a good idea for any and every restaurant. If the whole thing is just too confusing for you, or bookkeeping is too complex for one person to manage, an accountant can handle it for you. Even if you’ve got a good handle on the entire bookkeeping process, a professional accountant can help you interpret the information that your accounting produces.

Whether you’re just starting out in the restaurant business, or you’ve been doing it (and the accounting) for years, hiring an accountant is a great way to ensure that everything is being done correctly, that your business is profitable, and that you’re complying with all federal, state, and local tax and payroll laws.

To find the right accountant, talk to other managers, owners, or chefs to see who they use. Look for someone with knowledge of your local laws and experience in the restaurant accounting niche.

## 3\. Use The Right Tools To Simplify Restaurant Accounting

Whether you use an accountant for your day-to-day bookkeeping or not, you’re going to need to use the right tools to make your restaurant accounting easier. Tracking financials used to be done in complicated-looking, multi-columned ledgers. Those rows upon rows of figures would be enough to make even the most enthusiastic number lover rub their eyes in confusion. Thankfully, we no longer have to rely on ledgers and columnar pads. The computer has changed all that.

Accounting software products are everywhere these days so you’ve got plenty of choices. Brand-name products like [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) even make specialized modules that are specific to restaurant accounting.

The nice thing about many of these tools is that they look like a checkbook—something that most of us have experience with. That can make the learning curve just a bit easier.

As with hiring an accountant, talk to your friends in the business and see what tools they use to track their restaurant accounting. Then, take advantage of free trials and investigate numerous programs. You don’t have to spend a lot of time trying every feature of the application. Just enter a few transactions and see if things make sense to you.

## 4\. Choose A Good Point-Of-Sale System

This step in the restaurant account process is often overlooked. It’s overlooked because many managers don’t consider the decidedly “front-of-the-house” point-of-sale (POS) system as applicable to the “back-of-the-house” accounting system. That’s a shame because the two systems are intimately intertwined.

Imagine being able to link your POS system and your restaurant accounting system so that you could track inventory and [labor costs](https://getsling.com/blog/post/managing-millennials/), methods of payment, and a whole host of other variables. How much easier would your life be if the two systems worked well together? I think that question answers itself.

Like accounting software, point-of-sale software abounds these days. We mentioned QuickBooks in the accounting section above. The company also produces [QuickBooks Point Of Sale](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/point-of-sale/) which connects your business to your books with hardware and cloud-based software. QuickBooks is not the only option out there but we bring it up to illustrate the level of integration that is possible when you correctly pair your point-of-sale system and your restaurant accounting software.

## 5\. Pay Close Attention To Sales

The vast majority of restaurant sales depend on credit cards. Most credit card terminals require that you close out that batch of transactions every day. When you do that, the credit card company starts the process of transferring that money to your bank account. Basically, you’re going to have a deposit every day.

Because of those daily deposits, it’s important that your bookkeeping—the place you record money in and money out—mirror that activity. Some restaurants will wait until the end of the week to record one “lump sum”, but that doesn’t give you an accurate picture of your day-to-day sales. Day-to-day sales are important because they affect other aspects of the business like inventory and payroll. Be sure to record all sales—all money that came in—on a daily basis to make the reporting easier in the future.

## 6\. Get A Grip On Expenses

Every restaurant has [expenses](https://getsling.com/blog/post/restaurant-budget/). Keeping those expenses under control is one of the best ways to make your business profitable. Depending on how you pay and the arrangements you’ve made with vendors, bills may come due once a month, every two weeks, or even weekly.

Start out by entering and paying your bills once a week. As you gain some experience with restaurant accounting, you may discover that while sales need to be recorded every day, expenses may only need to be recorded every two weeks. It all depends on how you pay those bills.

Whatever terms you work under, don’t let your bills pile up. Taking a half hour every other day impacts your busy schedule less than an hour-and-a-half every week or three hours every two weeks.

## 7\. Consider Outsourcing Your Payroll

Yes, you could do the payroll yourself, but there a two good reasons why you should consider outsourcing the payroll portion of your restaurant accounting: liability and cost.

Payroll laws and taxes are constantly changing so staying in compliance with federal, state, local, and workforce requirements can be a full-time job. On top of that, if mistakes are made in withholding or payment, penalties and interest can be substantial. It’s better to have a trained, experienced professional handle your restaurant’s payroll so you don’t have to stay on top of all the complicated changes.

Another factor to consider is that of cost. Think about how long it would take you to slog through the payroll every week. Think about how long it would take you to stay current on all the myriad details that surround the different withholdings and taxes and fees for each employee. Now ask yourself, “What else could I be doing with that time?” There are, no doubt, much more important things you could be doing to help make your business profitable. The relatively small cost for outsourcing your payroll is more than offset by the [time](https://getsling.com/blog/post/effective-leaders/) you save and the stress you do away with.

## 8\. Produce Reports On A Regular Basis

Financial reports are the movie screen on which your restaurant’s profitability (or lack thereof) is displayed. Those reports are how you know what’s going on behind the scenes. Additionally, financial reports provide insight into what you can do to take your restaurant to the next level. That’s why it’s important to produce those reports on a regular basis.

Concentrate on such numbers as sales vs. expenses, labor ratios, and [prime cost](https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/articles/primetime.shtml). Another beneficial report is the profit and loss statement. This report can be produced weekly, monthly, quarterly, even yearly to show you in what directing your business is going financially.

But analyzing those reports can be a difficult proposition. What does that graph show? What does the difference between these two numbers mean? Is my restaurant heading in the right direction? This is where an accountant comes in handy. She can help you make sense of what all the numbers mean and make sure your restaurant accounting, and the restaurant itself, is on the right track.
