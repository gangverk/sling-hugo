+++
As a restaurant manager, you have a lot of responsibilities: plan menus, create and execute marketing, coordinate deliveries, organize employees, and ensure the smooth operation of your business. But unlike other jobs of similar complexity in other industries, you don’t have support departments to back you up. It’s all you.

Without a doubt, one of the more difficult tasks you face is scheduling your employees. Trying to create the perfect work schedule is often like trying to herd a kindle of kittens. But there are tools available that can help you with this process. Some can even act as your own personal HR department and provide input to simplify schedule creation. So what’s the best work schedule maker for restaurants? This article will answer that question.

## 1\. Pen & Paper

We start out with the most basic work schedule maker of all: pen and paper. As basic as pen and paper is, it is the most difficult to use and really does nothing to make your life easier. Yes, this method has been the go-to work schedule maker for...well, a really long time. But that doesn’t mean it’s your best option. In fact, the pen-and-paper method is likely what gave scheduling the rotten reputation it currently holds.

For one thing, it’s not easy to distribute. Yes, you can post it in the breakroom or outside your office, but what’s to ensure that your employees will look at it with enough time to notify you of conflicts?

For another thing, a pen-and-paper schedule isn’t the easiest thing to change...and you know you’re going to need to make changes. Sure, you can have a form you fill in, but that’s still a lot of work that could be done away with by using more modern methods.

## 2\. Word-Processing Software

With the advent and spread of computers in the late 20th century, word processors like Microsoft Word and WordPerfect replaced pen and paper as the default work schedule maker for many restaurants. But that doesn’t mean it’s a better tool for the job; just a more modern tool.

Many of the same problems still make the process difficult. You still have to create a form that is conducive to scheduling and easy for your employees to read. And have you ever tried to format something on a word processor and make it behave like you want it to? Sometimes, pen and paper is less frustrating.

Changes to the schedule might be a bit easier to make with a word processor because you don’t have to make a completely new form each time. But there’s still quite a bit of work involved in moving things around and getting shifts and employees where they should be.

You also still face the same challenges of distribution that make pen and paper so difficult. Sure, you now have the option of emailing your schedule to all employees simultaneously. But who’s to say that every employee will be able to open the schedule? And who’s to say the every employee even uses email? A vast majority don’t these days.

## 3\. Cloud-Based Word Processors

Cloud-based word processors like Google Docs are the 21st-century evolution of a 20th-century product. They are a step up from word processors of the past, but only a relatively small one. While these word processors solve one of the major issues involved in creating and distributing a schedule, many of the other issues remain.

The main advantage to using a cloud-based word processor as a work schedule maker is the ease of distribution. You create your schedule online through your preferred internet browser, save it in the cloud, and then grant access to all employees by sending them a link. Anyone can view the schedule anytime they want, making this method an extremely efficient way to get the schedule into everyone’s hands. This makes for a more productive team.

Ease of distribution aside, the difficulties that plagued the regular word processor still remain. You still have to struggle with formatting. And while making changes is somewhat streamlined because employees can leave notes regarding conflicts and trades, you still have to contend with making those changes work.

## 4\. Spreadsheets

Unlike word processors that start you out with a blank page, spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel gives you rows and columns as your default format. This in itself is a big step up from both pen and paper and word processors because you no longer have to work so hard to create the columns that designate days and the boxes that designate shifts. Spreadsheet software does it for you and makes the alteration and movement of those important pieces much, much easier.

So while spreadsheet software is much more flexible as a work schedule maker for restaurants, it still suffers from a number of problems. For one thing, spreadsheet software is still plagued by the distribution problems that both pen and paper and word processors struggle with. Should you print and post, hand out, or email everyone a copy? And once changes are needed (which they inevitably will be), which copy is the most recent? It can be hard for employees to keep track. That introduces a confusion factor that can make the process all the more difficult.

## 5\. Cloud-Based Spreadsheet Software

As with the word processors, moving spreadsheet software like Google Sheets online (i.e., into the cloud) streamlines the distribution process. That said, many other problems still remain.

It’s important to remember that spreadsheets were designed with database management and accounting in mind. The tools and solutions they offer are geared toward those activities, not toward scheduling. So while spreadsheets can be made to work for scheduling employees, they aren’t as powerful or as useful as other work schedule makers.

## 6\. Calendar Software

Calendar software like Microsoft Outlook can be an excellent replacement for pen and paper, word processors, spreadsheets, and their cloud-based counterparts. Calendar software is much more amenable to scheduling because it was created with that in mind. Times, days, weeks, months, and even years are already present and can be manipulated with ease. In addition, creating shifts, which on most calendars would be like tasks or appointments, is as easy as clicking a time slot and labeling it accordingly.

So while calendar software is a large step in the right direction, it still shouldn’t be classified as the best work schedule maker for restaurants. Calendar software like Microsoft Outlook was made for the use of a single individual. Because of that, it can be a bit difficult when you have to schedule more employees than you can count on one hand.

In addition, calendar software wasn’t created with overlapping shifts and other complicated scheduling practices in mind. Remember, it was intended for one person who could only be in one place at a time.

Calendar software also faces the same distribution challenges that make native word processors and spreadsheet programs obsolete. That’s not to say that you can’t make them work. It’s just that there are better solutions out there for restaurant scheduling.

## 7\. Cloud-Based Calendar Software

Online calendar software, like Google Calendar, builds on the relative ease of offline calendar software as a work schedule maker. These programs then take schedule creation to the next level by giving your schedule the power of cloud-based distribution.

Much like Google Docs and Google Sheets, Google Calendars are created online. You can then give permission to read or edit the document accordingly. Employees can view that schedule anytime, anywhere. This makes collecting and making changes simpler because employees can leave notes in the document informing you of conflicts. You will, of course, have to go back in and make the necessary changes, but you might also consider giving trusted employees permission to edit the schedule. That way, they can move their shifts to avoid conflicts and take some of the burden off your shoulders.

As great as these tools may sound, they were still not designed with multiple employees, overlapping shifts, and restaurant scheduling in mind.

## 8\. Sling

On top of all the tools dedicated to the scheduling process itself, Sling also acts as your own scheduling personal assistant. Sling will keep on eye on your work and notify you when you’ve unintentionally overlapped shifts or double booked an employee.
