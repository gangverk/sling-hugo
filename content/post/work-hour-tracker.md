+++
Tracking work hours on a daily basis is largely the responsibility of your employees. For many jobs, the process is simple: clock in at the start of the workday, and clock out at the end of the workday. For other jobs, though, tracking work hours can be difficult because employees might work on different projects for different clients throughout the day. Each of those projects needs to be tracked and the hours worked added to the client’s total.

As a manager, then, your job is to:

* Establish the rules and regulations that apply to work hours.

* Provide your employees with a work hour tracker.

* Make sure everyone is using the tracker correctly.

* Compile the work hours to calculate your employees’ paychecks.

As simple as that may sound, it leaves room for variation. Particularly when it comes to the work hour tracker you choose to manage all this information. Work hour trackers range in format and simplicity from a paper sign-in/sign-out sheet to a large software suite of which tracking time is just a small part.

Which method is right for your business and your employees? The experts at Sling are here to provide all the information you need to make an informed decision. Along the way, we’ll discuss:

* Sign-in/sign-out sheets.

* Manual time clocks.

* Software time clocks.

We’ll also give you a list of some of the more common work hour tracker apps, and then show you how to make tracking work hours easier with effective scheduling software. Before we get to that, though, let’s start with the simplest of all tracking methods: the sign-in sheet.

## 1) Sign-In/Sign-Out Sheets

The sign-in/sign-out sheet has been around for a long time. Your grandfather’s grandfather probably used a sign-in/sign-out sheet at one point in his career. The main benefit of this method is its simplicity.

At its most basic, the sign-in/sign-out sheet is composed of four columns. Employees simply sign their name in one column and enter the time they arrive at work in another. When their shift is over, employees sign their name in a third column and enter the time they left work in a fourth.

![Sign-In/Sign](/blog/forestryio/images/Work Hour Tracker_2.jpg "Sign-In/Sign-Out Sheet")The problem with sign-in/sign-out sheets is that mistakes can easily be made. Employees can forget to sign their name or forget to enter the time the arrived or left. Plus, the process of signing in can take quite a bit of time (relatively speaking, of course). If you have a large number of employees trying to sign in at the same time, it can cause problems.

We don’t recommend the sign-in/sign-out sheet for more than 10 employees, but it could still be useful for some businesses.

## 2) Manual Time Clocks

Manual time clocks replaced the sign-in/sign-out sheet as a more efficient—and less error-filled—work hour tracker. Manual time clocks were so effective that they’re still around in some industries, even after more than 100 years. Each employee is issued a card that they insert into the clock, and then he or she pushes the button on top to print the time.

Manual time clocks are more difficult to forge than sign-in/sign-out sheets. The only mistakes that can be made are forgetting to punch in/punch out, or printing the time on the wrong line. Manual time clocks do such an effective job tracking work hours that many automated, software-based systems still make use of them in one form or another. This leads us to our next topic: software time clocks.

## 3) Software Time Clocks

With the advent of computers, software time clocks grew in popularity. Employees used a manual time clock linked to a computer, or a computer terminal itself, to record their time in and out. Software time clocks reduced the number of errors because everything was automated. The only mistake that could be made was forgetting to sign in and out.

Software time clocks are still one of the best ways to track employee work hours in many industries. These work hour tracking solutions can even incorporate fingerprint or retinal scans to ensure that the correct employee is starting or leaving work. For a typical nine-to-five business where the employee clocks in, does her job, and then clocks out, software time clocks are an ideal work hours tracker.

But what happens if an employee needs to track work hours for multiple projects while she’s in (or out) of the office? That leads us to our next type of work hour tracker.

## 4) Mobile Work Hours Tracker Apps

Many professions require that employees track billable time for various projects. A lawyer, for example, may spend two hours on one case, 45 minutes on another, and five hours on a third during her nine-to-five workday. How is she to document that time? With a mobile work hour tracker app.

Mobile work hour tracker apps can be used both in and out of the office to record time for one (or multiple) projects. Some of these apps are even replacing the software time clock as the go-to choice for a simple clock-in, work, clock-out process. These apps are relatively simple to operate, only require a smartphone or mobile device, and can be linked to other software to provide invoicing and other services.

### 1) Timewerks

Timewerks allows users to track multiple projects and clients at any given time. You can track time automatically with the touch of a button or add time manually later on. You can then export your data to a variety of formats (i.e., Excel) or produce a work hour tracker report from the app itself.

### 2) iPunchclock

iPunchclock can be used by your employees to clock in/clock out and track time spent on different tasks. iPunchclock can also report the longitude and latitude (and altitude) where tasks are performed.

You can verify that your employees did indeed start and end work at your restaurant on time because the app shows where they were while it was running. That’s a powerful solution for your work hour tracker dilemma.

### 3) TimeClock
