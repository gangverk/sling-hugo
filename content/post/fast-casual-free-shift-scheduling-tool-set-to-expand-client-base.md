[Sling](https://getsling.com) bills itself as “the only free shift-scheduling tool for non-desk employees,” and it’s being used by huge employers like Subway and AMC Theatres, so its first-year progress report could be of interest across the restaurant industry.

Since its 2015 launch, Sling has acquired 1,500 clients who use the tool to schedule employees, message internally, communicate company news and manage some tasks, according to a press release. The results are encouraging enough that the company isnow planning expansion.

“We are thrilled to have received such an overwhelmingly positive response to our technology in such a short space of time,” said Sling CEO Helgi Hermannsson in the release. “Our simple, yet effective tool offers employees and employers a seamless solution to stay connected and organized. Hospitality, restaurants and retail businesses all benefit from Sling’s easy-to-use communication [app](https://getsling.com/blog/post/work-schedule-app/).”

Here are some of the first-year results reported by the company and how they will be used for expanded use of the app in new areas:

• **$2.5 million in revenue from initial $500,000 pre-seed funding**. Proceeds will be used to expand, increase support and add to the platform.

• **1,500 new clients in more than seven business categories** report better employee engagement and efficiency.

• **Upgrades that streamline functions for managers** allowing everything from email to Excel and Facebook to be organized into a single platform.

• **Expanded management team**, including newly appointed Director of Customer Success Ashley Nicholson, formerly of Humanity.

“Sling conveniently keeps the lines of communication open between [management](https://getsling.com/blog/post/call-center-management/) and staff and alerts [employees ](https://getsling.com/blog/post/schedule-my-employees/)to their shifts before work,” said Sling Client and Mansion House General Manager Stacey Langelaan.
