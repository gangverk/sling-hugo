**Apple announces macOS and iOS 10 public beta releases**

Apple launched public betas of the latest iterations of its OS X, which has now been rebranded as macOS, and the tenth iteration of iOS, it’s mobile operating system. According to Information Week, “The betas, unfinished previews really, are unstable and buggy, but let the general public test the newest software features months before the platforms are released to everyone. There is a bit of risk involved, but to some, the rewards may be worth the effort.” New features in macOS include the ability to unlock Macs with an Apple Watch, a universal clipboard that works across iOS and macOS devices, an extension of Apple Pay to the computer, and, of course, the addition of the digital assistant Siri. Where in the past iOS has been closed off, iOS 10 marks a new direction for Apple: Siri, iMessage, and Maps are now open to third-party developers. iOS 10 also features a redesigned UI and updated UX. You can try out the new iOS and macOS via Apple’s Beta Software Program, which is free to join.

**Karma unveils Private Networks premium feature**

Karma has launched a new premium feature that gives users of its Karma Go device the ability to convert their hotspots into a more traditional, private internet network. For those unfamiliar with the hotspot company, Karma has created a business out of “sharing internet access with others… through a hotspot service” with a device called Karma Go. Users subscribe to a data service and then can take Go anywhere to connect to the internet. Unlike other hotspots, however, other Karma users in the vicinity can log into a single Go hotspot — the Go owner then receives credit for every person they share their internet with, which either turns into extra data they can use later or transfer the savings to their bill for credit. The new private networks feature is available as a premium feature and “carries a $15 per month charge on pay-as-you-go plans and $5 per month charge on subscription data plans.”
