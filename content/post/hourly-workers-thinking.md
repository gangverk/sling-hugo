Working enough hours is slightly more important to hourly workers than their pay rate, but these employees still believe in raising the national minimum wage.

Those are some of the findings of the 2016 annual “State of the Hourly Worker” report published this summer by Snagajob, a job listing site for hourly workers.

The organization, which claims 70 million users and conducted 1,000 interviews for its survey, produced some illuminating findings about what makes hourly employees tick.

Knowing this information can help managers attract better talent, reduce turnover, and better understand the changing environment of the workforce. That’s particularly true in fields that rely on Millennial staff members, like the retail and restaurant industries.

Hourly workers make up about 60 percent of the entire U.S. work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the report.

And most of them desire full-time jobs, Snagajob’s study found. A vast majority (88 percent) of them are open to working multiple jobs to achieve enough hours to fill a whole work week, according to the numbers.

All that juggling is why scheduling software like Sling is so essential in minimizing the stress of coordinating calendars with thousands of employees.

An interesting tidbit in the study reflects and overall shift in Millennials’ lives – more and more young people are living at home.

Nearly half (45.4 percent) of the study’s overwhelmingly young respondents (about 60 percent were younger than 35) live with parents or family. The rest own their homes (17.9 percent) rent alone or with roommates (28.9 percent) or have another living situation.

These workers are predominantly female, more likely to use their mobile phones to find jobs, drive to work instead of using public transit, and expect their jobs to last three years or fewer.

They want retail jobs (32.8 percent) over restaurant work (20.5 percent) and desire perks like stipends or discounts at their workplaces.

It should be noted that this is just one snapshot into the lives of hourly workers.

But the insights are useful in thinking about how to hire and maintain a staff that’s the right fit for any business.
