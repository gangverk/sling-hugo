+++


Call center management is, by no means, an easy job. It requires strategic vision, hard work, difficult decisions, the ability to motivate people to hit tough targets, and much more. 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/effective-leaders/">Effective leaders</a> in the call center industry need to be familiar with every aspect of their business, lead by example, and work within strict budgets. It can be overwhelming at times. To help you get out from under this overwhelmed feeling, and move you and your call center closer to success, we’ve compiled a list of the 10 best practices for effective call center management.

## 1. Hire The Best Employees

It’s essential for successful call center management, but few managers put enough time and energy into 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/find-employees/">hiring the best employees</a> for the job. Call centers need people with a natural ability for customer service, good listening skills, effective communication skills, an excellent memory, and an enthusiastic attitude. It’s the intangibles like enthusiasm and ability to listen that often make the best employees. And the tricky thing is, these traits can’t be taught. That’s why it’s so important that savvy managers take the time to screen new employees for attitude and aptitude.

## 2. Provide Thorough Onboarding![](/blog/forestryio/images/image03-11.jpg)

Hiring is only a very small part of successful call center management. Granted, it’s an important part, but hiring mistakes can be mitigated through a thorough onboarding process that teaches good habits and communicates your high standards. We recommend putting special emphasis on training employees how to deal with customer complaints. The bulk of their calls will probably be of this type so it’s important to prepare them right from the beginning. Make sure that your employees see customer complaints as an opportunity to provide great service rather than an obstacle that needs to be crossed. With a thorough onboarding program in place, your new employees will feel better able to handle any type of call that comes their way. That makes for a happier employee, and ultimately, a happier customer.

## 3. Prioritize Employee Engagement

Call centers have a notorious reputation as difficult places to work. Whether that label is true or not, it can make attracting good employees and minimizing turnover an overwhelming job. Attracting good employees starts with the hiring process, but minimizing turnover is a direct product of 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-engagement-ideas/">employee engagement</a>. Effective employee engagement can be as simple as talking with your employees each day, or as elaborate as a team retreat. Engagement activities like holding brainstorming sessions, or a team happy hour, can make your employees feel like part of a team, and keep them on point and ready to handle customer problems. Take the time to institute some employee engagement programs to keep your team’s motivation and performance at a high level.

## 4. Ensure Proper Scheduling For Effective Call Center Management

Working in a call center can be a high-stress job. That stress can have a negative effect on your employees. The moment they begin to feel overworked, their ability to perform at a high level decreases. That’s where 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/schedule-my-employees/">proper scheduling</a> comes in. Giving your employees enough downtime to recharge and refocus, can ensure that your customers receive the patient and friendly service they deserve.

But even a small-sized team can be difficult to schedule. There are so many variables and moving parts to contend with that the job can seem well-nigh impossible. Factors such as what is good for the call center, peak and low hours, employee ability, employee availability, and a whole host of others, can turn scheduling into a full-time job. That’s why it’s important to make use of the best tools available for the job. A digital solution like

This can mean the difference between the highest quality of service possible and merely average service.

## 5. Communicate Regularly With Your Employees![](/blog/forestryio/images/call center.jpg)

There’s no experience like first-hand experience. Though you may not be on the frontline of the call center everyday, your employees are. They are familiar with the customer service process inside and out. That makes them more aware of where the problems lie, and perhaps more cognizant of what is necessary to fix them.

You can learn what your employees know by communicating with them regularly. Find out where they’re having problems. Ask them what they need to do a good job. Get their feedback on what’s important to the customers. And see if they have any suggestion for making things better.

## 6. Give Employees Targeted Feedback

Regular quality-of-service assessment is vital for the successful operation of any call center. Take the time to listen to your employees’ performance and then be ready to offer targeted feedback so they can improve. Do this evaluation systematically so that you can gauge the abilities of each and every employee. And while targeted feedback can lead to profound change, sometimes it may not be enough. We suggest you establish an ongoing-training program to reinforce the standards you’ve set for your quality of service.

## 7. Use Data When Making Decisions![](/blog/forestryio/images/call center manager.jpg)

Just about all decision-making in business is driven by data these days. Your call center management should be too. Set goals and establish appropriate metrics to reach those goals. It’s important for managers to be familiar with the metrics that are most applicable to their employees and customers.

Once you’ve set your goals and established your metrics, gather as much data as possible using your call center software to gain insight into your operations. Metrics such as Net Promoter Score® (
<a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/nps-improve-call-center">NPS</a>) and customer satisfaction (
<a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/csat-improve-call-center" class="">CSat</a>) should play a role in your decision-making as should number of calls, and successful outcome of calls. Other metrics may be necessary for your particular call center but these are always a good place to start.

## 8. Delegate Responsibilities To Your Employees

It can be very easy for a call center manager to get bogged down in the specific details of the job. There are a myriad of small tasks that need to get done for a call center to run smoothly. But there are also a lot of high-level strategy decisions that can keep your call center performing at its best. It’s these later jobs and decisions that an effective manager should focus on.

To do that, however, you need to delegate responsibility for the small tasks to your employees. Delegating not only helps you find time for the bigger issues, it empowers the employees to whom you’ve given that added responsibility. To set your employees up for success, and to ensure that the jobs you delegate get done correctly, it’s important that you set up a process that doesn’t require that the employee consult with you on every decision. Such a framework might be communicated through a company guidebook, or by giving certain employees access to higher functions in your call center software. Whatever form your framework takes, be sure to give your employees the freedom and the tools necessary to get the job done. Letting go of some of your lesser responsibilities can be difficult—especially when you’re still responsible for that job. But when you delegate successfully, it allows you to turn your attention to more important issues that can have a major effect on the success of your call center.

## 9. Establish Positive Incentives For Good Work

Encourage your employees to do their best work, all the time. One of the best ways to do this is through positive incentives. Quotas, contests, and rewards can provide positive incentives in a number of different ways. First, they can keep employees motivated when the calls get difficult. Second, they can help maintain a higher level of morale throughout your entire team. And third, they can make employees feel 
<a href="https://getsling.com/blog/post/employee-appreciation/">appreciated</a>. When your employees feel appreciated, they’re more than likely to go the extra mile to provide high-quality customer service when the need arises. That benefits them, you, and the entire company.

## 10. Improve The Process By Putting Yourself In Your Employees’ Shoes

Communicate with your employees regularly to find out the problems they see and the concerns they have about the customer service process. But nothing helps you improve your call center activities like putting yourself in your employees’ shoes once in a while.

Donning a headset and taking a few calls will give you a better understanding of the challenges your employees face on a daily basis. It will help you see what they need to do their job better. It will help you see what your customers need. It will help you refine the strategy that governs your call center and show you how you can improve the process overall. Putting yourself on the frontline with your employees is also a great way to lead by example. It engenders respect and shows that you’re not so far above your employees that you’re not willing to get your hands dirty when it’s necessary.
