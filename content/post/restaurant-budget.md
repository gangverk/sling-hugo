+++
Preparing a restaurant budget yields many benefits. Chief amongst those benefits is being able predict operating expenses, being able to spend less than you make, and being able to use profits to grow the business.

Without a restaurant budget, you’re basically flying blind. Yes, you may have a specific destination in mind, but without a budget, you have no way of knowing how much you need to spend and what you need to earn to cover that spending. It’s that important. A restaurant budget—even a very basic one—can get you pointed in the right direction and on your way to every restaurant owner or manager’s goal: a profitable business.

But how, exactly, do you go about creating a restaurant budget that works? This article will show you the best way to get started.

## 1\. Choose How You Want To Track Your Numbers

The foundation of your budget is numbers. More specifically, tracking those numbers. So you’re going to need to institute some method of recording and organizing said numbers. This can be something as simple as a piece of paper or as complex as a specialized accounting program.

That said, some form of computerized record keeping is your best bet. Businesses kept track of their numbers for decades using ledger books and columnar pads. But those options can be difficult to reconcile and even more difficult to change should mistakes be made.

Digital records take the form of a very general spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel all the way up to a very specific restaurant-focused accounting and budgeting package like [QuickBooks For Restaurants](https://payroll.intuit.com/restaurant-accounting/). Regardless of the method you choose, you’ll need some way to keep track of things like immediate costs, daily sales, projected expenses, and much more so make sure the software you choose can handle everything.

## 2\. Calculate Costs

Many of the costs associated with running a restaurant can be anticipated. You know you’ll have fixed costs that stay pretty much the same from month to month or year to year like insurance and rent or loan payments. You know you’ll have semi-variable costs that will change from month to month like employee wages and utilities. And you know you’ll have variable costs that will change constantly like supplies and repairs.

Don’t get bogged down in the minutiae of fixed vs. [semi-variable](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semivariablecost.asp) vs. variable. Just record what you spend every day, every week, and every month. Then, add up the number to produce a total costs number for the month.

Alternatively, you could calculate your totals every two weeks. This works well if you pay your employees bimonthly. Honestly, you can record your costs on whatever timeframe works best for you. Sometimes it’s nice to see what you need to make every day in order to cover your costs. Sometimes you don’t need that amount of precision. It all depends on what you need to get ahold of your restaurant budget.

## 3\. Estimate And Track Sales

If you’re just starting out in the restaurant industry, you’ll have to estimate your sales for the week or the month when preparing your restaurant budget. You should have some idea of what that number should be. If you don’t, you’ll need to do some research or look at past numbers if they’re available. In the best of situations, your estimated sales will exceed the costs calculated in the step above. If sales don’t exceed costs, that’s the first thing you need to work on.

If you’ve been in business for some time, you likely have some kind of record of sales whether it’s in the form of tax returns, receipts, a ledger, or something else. You can use those numbers as a basis for projecting sales.

Then, regardless of whether you are just starting out or have been in business for a while, you’re going to need to start tracking sales on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. This will help you get a handle on inflows versus outflows and show you whether or not you need to cut expenses, whether or not you’re making a profit, what is driving those sales (food or beer or something else), and where you can improve.

## 4\. Compare Your Sales And Your Costs

This is where the power of a restaurant budget starts to take shape. When you compare your costs for the month and your sales for the month, it will give you a good idea of the financial condition of your business.

If your goal is profitability (as it should be), you’ll see right away if you’re on target when you put your sales numbers and your cost numbers side by side. Let’s say that your costs for the month are $100,000\. Then let’s say that your sales for the month are $90,000\. What does that tell you?

It tells you that you need to make some changes.

## 5\. Make Changes So That Sales Always Cover Costs

When your restaurant budget shows you that there’s a $10,000 difference between your costs and your sales, it’s time to make changes. Those changes could take many different forms and it really depends on what’s right for you.

You may work harder to drive new customers into your restaurant. You may focus on increasing repeat customers. You may decide to cuts costs somehow. You may decide to increase your prices. You may decide to do all these things. Whatever you choose, your goal is to get your sales to cover your costs. That’s the most basic principle of running a business. If you don’t make this a reality fairly quickly, you won’t be in business for very long.

## 6\. Work To Increase Profits

With the work you’ve done so far in getting your restaurant budget together, you’ll be able to quickly see what you need to work on. And once you’ve got your sales covering your costs, your next goal should be to increase profits. Profit is the difference between your sales and your costs. When your costs exceed your sales, you’ve got a deficit (you’re in the red). When your sales exceed your costs, you’ve got a profit (you’re in the black).

When your profits are consistently exceeding your costs, it’s time to start focusing on ways to further separate those numbers. This goes back to many of the same choices you had when you were trying to get sales to cover costs: pull in new customers, drive repeat customers, cut costs, increase prices, the list goes on and on.

Remember that the original purpose of a restaurant—other than great food and great service—is to make a profit. Whatever you can do to make your profits grow while keeping your costs fairly static fulfills that original purpose. Once such way to keep your costs under control is to simplify employee scheduling and track how much they work.

## 7\. Use Software To Keep Wages Under Control

Using software is one of the best ways to keep your restaurant budget under control while at the same time working to increase your profits. One of the biggest cost in your budget will likely be wages. Apps like Sling can help with that.

Using [Sling](http://getsling.com) serves two primary purposes. First, it helps make [scheduling](https://getsling.com/blog/post/work-schedule/) easier. Scheduling employees can be one of the most difficult parts of running a restaurant. Sling helps make that part easier by allowing you to schedule faster using tools like copy and paste, recurring shifts, and color-coded employees. Sling even assists you by notifying you if you’ve overlapped shifts or double-booked someone. Once your schedule is complete, Sling makes it simple to get that schedule into everyone’s hands. Distributing the schedule is as easy as sharing a link with all your employees. Once the schedule has been sent, Sling even sends notifications to employees reminding them when they work or when a shift has become available.

The second purpose of the Sling app, is to help you keep wage expenditures under control. Sling does this by helping you monitor overtime so that you don’t exceed costs because you accidently scheduled someone for too much time each week. These apps also help decrease the time it takes for you to get other things done associated with guiding your employees. Sling helps you communicate faster by allowing you to send messages, files, photos, videos, even links to individuals, user-defined groups, of your entire staff with just the push of a button.

That often invisible time savings can add up to a significant cost savings and allow you to focus more on keeping your restaurant in the black.

## Use Budgeting Software And Scheduling Software For The Best Results

Creating a restaurant budget is an integral part of running a successful business. So too is streamlining the scheduling process and keeping wage expenditures under control. Because these two tasks are crucial for the success of any business, it’s best make use of both a budgeting/accounting program as well as a scheduling program like Sling.

Used together, these tools can give you detailed insight into the inner workings of your restaurant and powerful control over the costs associated with your employees.
